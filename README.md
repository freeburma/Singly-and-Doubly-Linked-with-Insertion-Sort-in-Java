# Singly-and-Doubly-Linked-with-Insertion-Sort-in-Java

I attempted both Singly and Doubly Linked List for insertion sort, however, my doubly linked list backward sorting has a bug. 
I'v tried to fix it since last week. I could't find it. Sometimes it will sort successfully and sometimes it don't. I did implement
doubly linked List forward algorithm. I want you to test it fast. You can see I can sort it forward. 
To test please type : java <fileName> <-fb> <50000>  
				            : java mySort -fb 5000
					
I want you to try to test a couple of times for backward alogrithm. 

Sorry for bugs. I tried everything that I know. 

Some codes are dirctly retrieved. I lost the link to refernece. Sorry for it. Whenever you found the similar code, please thank to original creator. 
Not me. Especially, insertion sorting alogrithm. 

Thank you

Got only 84% for final grade.
